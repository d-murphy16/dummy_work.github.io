    "- Electricity is one of the most important blessings that science has given to mankind. It has also become a part of modern life and one cannot think of a world without it.From **household chores to trade & industrial growth**, it plays a major role in our lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is evident from that fact that World Bank mentions **Getting Electricity** as one of the prime indicators of **Ease of doing Business**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Primary conventional energy sources for generating electricity are **Coal, Lignite, Gas, Diesel, Nuclear & Hydro** while non-conventional renewable energy sources are **Solar, Wind, Biogas etc.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Electricity is produced at generating plants run by companies called **GENCOS**, then is transmitted by effective transimmsion network run by companies called **TRANSCOS** & finally it is distributed to the residential/commercial premises by the **DISCOMS**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Though **access to the electricity** has increased upto a large extent in last 20 years (**India being the energy surplus country**), its reliability, effective distribution & satisfaction to the end consumer has remain the challenge.\n",

    "# **2. Problem Statement**\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "- Despite approximately 99% electrification in villages, towns, and cities across India, the challenge lies in ensuring **access to reliable electricity**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Frequently, issues such as prolonged **power cuts or low voltage availability/fluctuations** are encountered, particularly in semi-urban and rural areas, making demographic study imperative.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Demographic factors** including poverty, education/awareness levels, the efficiency of local distributors, and government policies play pivotal roles in addressing these challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recognizing **renewable energy sources** as the potential future of distributed generation, creating awareness about these technologies is equally vital.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hence, this project focuses on analyzing following problem statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "        1. Access to Reliable Electricity\n",
    "        2. Availability of Major Electrical Equipments & Consumption Pattern\n",
    "        3. Awareness of Alternative/Renewable Energy Sources\n",

    "**<h4>Dataset: Indian Residential Energy Survey,2020 (CEEW)</h4>**\n",
    "\n",
    "- <a href=\"https://www.ceew.in/\">**CEEW**</a>, The Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) stands as a prominent not-for-profit policy research institution in Asia. Renowned for its commitment to fostering positive change, CEEW employs a combination of data-driven insights, integrated analysis, and strategic outreach to elucidate and transform the dynamics surrounding the utilization, recycling, and mismanagement of resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "- As part of its extensive research endeavors, CEEW conducted the '**Indian Residential Energy Survey (IRES), 2020**' This comprehensive pan-India survey was designed to delve into the nuanced landscape of energy access and consumption patterns within Indian households. By undertaking such initiatives, CEEW contributes significantly to the discourse on sustainable energy practices and informs evidence-based policymaking in the domain of energy and the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The survey covers:\n",

    "\n",
    "- IRES, the Indian Residential Energy Survey of 2020, serves as a rich source of detailed information, encompassing a comprehensive questionnaire featuring 614 distinct features. This survey meticulously captures insights into critical aspects such as the state of electricity, accessibility to cooking energy, energy consumption, and expenditure patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Furthermore, the survey explores the nuances of equipment characteristics tailored for major end-uses, including cooking, lighting, space cooling, heating, entertainment, and more. It also delves into the dynamics of appliance purchase behavior and assesses the level of awareness among Indian households regarding star labels and energy conservation practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- By offering an extensive and nuanced understanding of these dimensions, IRES emerges as a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders engaged in shaping strategies for sustainable energy use and conservation in the context of Indian households\n",
    "\n",
    "- Checkout <a href=\"https://youtu.be/cCyMZmSQwaY\">**Talks of CEEW**</a> to get better clarity about the Survey.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**<h4>Selection of Dataset</h4>**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The aforementioned survey comprehensively addresses a spectrum of crucial topics spanning from demography to the state of electricity, energy consumption and expenditure, appliance characteristics and purchase behavior, to awareness of energy conservation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the course of conducting the study and subsequent analysis, **a judiciously chosen subset of the raw data has been utilized**. The rationale guiding this selective acquisition and description of data is expounded upon in the following section, under 'Data Acquisition & Description.' This strategic approach aims to distill key insights from the wealth of information contained in the survey, allowing for a focused and insightful examination of pertinent factors shaping the energy landscape within Indian households.\""

    "\n",
    "- Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Chattigarh, Madhya Pradesh & Rajastan are the top 5 states with maximum share of household having no grid availability. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Solar Home System (SHS) as well as Battery System is found to be in rural homes most. It states that solar has not been more popular among urban area & is a key area of business to focus on.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rural areas have larger power cuts as compared to urban areas with mean availability of 19.6 hours as compared to 22 hours in urban areas. Reilability is very important for the revenue generation to the DISCOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Urban areas have mean availability of 5.4 hours in evening as compared to rural areas having 4.97 hours. This states that there is a greater need of battery storage in evening time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Jharkhand, Assam, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar & Chattishgarh are the least 5 states with maximum power cuts in urban areas. Hence, these are the key states to focus on for the reliability.\n"
